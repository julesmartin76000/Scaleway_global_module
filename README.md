# Terraform module: deploy your infrastructure in a click

Scaleway's products can be used and deployed through Terraform.
The purpose of this guide is to help users deploy their infrastructure in a safe and quick way, thanks to a module provided by Scaleway team.


## Pre-requisites

Before starting on the project, you need to have an [account](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account/), your [credentials](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-account/concepts/#api-key) all set up, and [install Terraform ](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) on the server you are using, or locally, using  the last version of the Scaleway Terraform [provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs).


## The workflow

1. Clone or fork this repository (if you want to add changes)
2. Set up the right ``bucket`` and the right ``key`` in your `backend.tf`
